# spring-reactive-reactive-handler-service
This repository contains a simple reactive Spring Boot Message handling service.
It takes one request to an endpoint /api/sendMessage/{message} and will send the contents of the 
ServerRequest back to the user.

You can use this simple service to build more complex services based upon this pattern.
